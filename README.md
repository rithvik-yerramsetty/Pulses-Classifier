# Pulses-Classifier
This CNN model classifies the given image into five types of pulses ('black_gram', 'chick_pea', 'green_gram', 'pigeon_pea', 'ren_lentil'). Performed transfer learning with ResNet convolutional neural network architecture and fined tuned it with dataset containing around 1000 images of different types of pulses to get an accuracy of 92.15 on the
test set.
